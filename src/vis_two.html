    <u><b>Question: </b></u>
    <p>
        What musical features are used to make the most popular music and how are those features used by the most
        popular musicians?
    </p>

    <hr style="color: white">

    <u><b>Description: </b></u>
    <p>
        The chart above shows each of the musical features present in the dataset(excl. "Instrumentalness", more on this
        in the Data Filtering section) plotted against the corresponding track popularity value for the top 10 most
        popular artists. There are two aims to the chart, one is to be able to identify what musical features the most popular musicians
        tracks are composed off and two what are the general trends of these features across the most popular musicians?
    </p>
    <p>
        The chart shows all the data points for the top 10 most popular artists, this can be refined to select
        individual artists using the artist selection menu just below the graph. The selection can then be reset by
        clicking anywhere on the chart.
    </p>

    <hr style="color: white">

    <u><b>Insight: </b></u>
    <p>
        Overall, there doesn't appear to be any correlation between popularity and any of the musical features. Most of
        charts have their data points in a relatively straight, horizontal line, which would indicate a correlation
        coefficient
        that is close to zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        Acoustiness has a significant cluster of points below 0.1 which lines up with the artists present, the
        points above this line can be accounted for by artists such as Ed Sheeran whose music is created using a lot of
        acoustic guitar. From the previous chart the median value for acousticness has been between 0.03 and 0.125, with
        an upward trend in the past five years. This matches the acousticness chart for this question as most of the
        points
        are clustered below 0.1 and the artists present have mostly produced music in the past decade.
    </p>
    <p>
        A similar pattern can be seen in the liveness feature. Most of the points are clustered below 0.2. This again
        reflects the genres produced by the top 10 artists, three of the top 10 artists are DJs (Sam Feldt, Avicii and
        Martin Garrix), who tend to have a higher liveness value compared to other types of artist.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are not "speechy", which is a common feature in genres such as Rap. Rap is not the style of music for any
        of the top 10 artists in this dataset, they are mostly Pop and EDM.
    </p>
    <p>
        The valence chart shows that the perceived positivity of the top artists music is quite diverse with a fairly
        equal
        spread of points above and below the 0.5 mark. While roughly equal there is more points below 0.5, this shows
        that
        overall the music produced by these artists is more negative. This lines up with the overall trend in valence
        since
        the 1960s (as seen in the previous chart) which showed that music was becoming more negative in general over
        the past decade and the fact that the music produced by the top 10 artists has been released in the past 10
        years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the ability to select individual artists it is possible to get a more in-depth look at what makes up the
        music of the most popular artists. I won't discuss all 10 as it would take up a lot of space and isn't
        necessary,
        instead I will pick a subset of them to get a picture of what makes up their music.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><u>Ed Sheeran</u></b> is a singer-songwriter whose predominant genre is Pop, and it is possible to say that
        his earlier work falls more so in the Acoustic Pop genre. When the chart is filtered to show the points relating
        to his tracks a clear picture is painted in terms of what musical features make up his music. He has a number of
        tracks which score high for acousticness, especially compared to the other artists. His most popular tracks
        score
        high for danceability, energy and valence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><u>Katy Perry</u></b> is another pop musician but differs from Ed Sheeran in her use of acoustic instruments,
        this is seen in the low values of acousticness for her tracks. She maintains a consistent popularity value above
        50 with only a small number of outliers below this threshold. In general her most popular music is a mix of
        being slightly positive and slightly negative, while being very energetic.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><u>Martin Garrix</u></b> is a DJ whose predominant genre would fall into EDM. His most popular music is
        moderately
        negative with his most popular tracks having a valence value of less than 0.5. While they are negative, the most
        popular tracks are energetic and danceable. This is no suprise since EDM in general is scores high for energy
        and
        danceability.
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of information can be drawn from this chart and it compliments the previous chart depicting the trends in
        the musical features over the decades. The most popular artists score high for both energy and danceability,
        both
        of these have seen upward trends in recent years. Their music is also quite varied in terms of it valence
        (perceived positivity), but it does lean more on the negative side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then when we look into individual artists, it's no surprise that, in general, their more popular tracks have
        higher
        scores for energy and danceability.
    </p>
    <hr style="color: white">
    <u><b>Design Considerations: </b></u>
    <p>
        The target audience for this chart is the same as it is for all three visualizations, and that is those from who
        are more interested in music than your average person and also those with some background in data analysis such
        that they already have even a mild understanding of interpreting charts and concepts such as correlations etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        My original thoughts for this question was to investigate how each of the features made up each genre. I created
        a radar plot for this, which showed the composition for each genre. However, the dataset is quite limited in the
        amount of genres present, there is only six available when in reality there are many more (to name a few well
        known ones,
        Classical, Hip-Hop, Indie etc.). The genres do expand slightly when you look at the "playlist_subgenre" field
        but these are mostly compositions of the main genres, e.g. edm & pop. It was because of this I felt the need to
        add more dimensions to this questions, track popularity and then to refine this, the top 10 artists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I had decided on this new question, I had a number of different methods available to me to present the
        information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heatmaps are similar to scatter plots, with a big difference being that individual points are binned together so
        as to form bins which will have different colours to indicate density. This method would take a similar shape to
        the final small multiples scatter plot used. Heatmaps are useful for identifying dense clusters of data points.
        However, that wasn't the aim of this chart. Another drawback of using a heatmap for this chart was that due to
        lack of data, i.e. each artist only had a relatively small amount of tracks and they had varying feature values,
        a heatmap for an individual artist didn't show a lot of information and was quite sparse depending on the
        artist. Due to this I decided that more information could be retrieved from that chart by using points rather
        than binned rectangles.
    </p>
    <p>
        A small alternative to the final chart was to give each of the different artists a unique color. This would
        allow
        for easier identification of the artists when all points are displayed at once. There was some drawback with
        this, since there was data for 10 artists there would have been 10 colours used, this made the chart very
        chaotic
        in clusters of data points and more time would be spent trying to match up colours to artists that actually
        looking
        at
        the data in the chart. I could have reduced the number of artists to five, I felt this didn't get as much
        information
        across and wasn't a good enough tradeoff for having colours represent each artist. A variation on this would
        have
        been to use different marks for each artist but this also had the same pitfall as different colours, which was
        that
        it becomes very chaotic and the person reading that chart has to spend time matching marks to artists using a
        legend.
    </p>
    <p>
        My solution to the previous problem was to include the ability to select individual artists from a selection
        menu
        and have that grey out all the other artists. I think this worked really well and enables the user to either
        get a broad overview of the musical features that make up the most popular artists and then by selecting an
        individual artists the user can get a more in-depth look at what makes up the music of that artist.
    </p>
    <p>
        A box plot could also have been used as an alternative to the final scatter plots. This would have worked by binning
        the data into bins based on popularity(e.g. 0-10, 90-100 etc.). Then each of those bins would have a box and the
        associated whiskers based on the mean and standard deviation. I decided not to use this as it had similar issues
        as the heatmap alternative. Since points would have been grouped together the finer details of having all the points
        would be lost, which I didn't think was appropriate given what I wanted the chart to convey.
    </p>
    <p>
        A single scatter plot could have been used with all features present on it, differentiated by colour. This chart
        would contain a very large amount of points and would be very difficult to extract information. A solution would
        be to use the selection ability I used to the final chart but this would also require removing the ability to
        choose
        an artist or add another selection so as to have the ability to select an artist alongside a feature. This
        seemed
        overly complicated and an easier solution was to just use small multiples based on features.
    </p>
    <p>
        After considering the above options I felt the best way forward was to use the small multiples approach with
        individual scatter plots for each of the features. Then using a selection option it was possible to get both a
        high level overview of the composition of the musical features for the most popular artists and then also be
        able
        to get a more refined look at the breakdown per artist.

    <u><b>Data Filtering/Aggregation/Transforms: </b></u>
    <p>
        This chart required a bit more transforming and filtering compared to the others. A modified version of the
        dataset
        was constructed in python and is available on my GitHub for inspection. To get the required data for this chart
        I
        first had to filter out both NaN and Infinity values from the dataset. Then when I was working with the dataset
        I
        noticed that there was a significant amount of duplicate track entries. These were the same track with the same
        feature values, popularity etc. but differed on the playlist_genre. Several songs, which ended up distorting my
        original attempts at transforming this dataset, had entries for every genre in the dataset for a given song. To
        resolve this I dropped duplicate track_name entries.
    </p>
    <p>
        From here I calculated the median popularity value for each artist and then took the top 10 artists using this
        value. With the top 10 calculated I then had to transpose the feature columns to rows so as to easily
        create small multiples based on those features.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final dataset contains the top 10 artists and all of their tracks that are present in the dataset and the
        popularity,
        features and their corresponding values, for each of those tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
        When using the dataset in Vega-Lite I filtered out the "Instrumentalness" feature. This was done after
        inspecting the
        dataset as well as using it for another chart in this assignment. The median value for "instrumentalness" across
        the
        dataset is approx. 0.0 except for one year and because of this I felt that it didn't contribute to the chart or
        what it was trying to convey. I think that this is caused by the relatively small sample size of the dataset
        , approx. 32,000 entries, compared to the full Spotify catalogue, which contains approx. 70 million songs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also considered filtering out tracks that had a track_popularity of zero. I thought that it didn't make sense
        for a track to have a popularity of zero. After some investigating into the dataset I found out that a popularity
        score of zero means that there just wasn't enough listens on a track for it to give a meaningful score. I included
        these tracks in the end as they still had their musical features defined and they didn't have any significant
        impact on identifying correlations between features and popularity.
